## Requirements

Follow the prerequisites for tauri from here:
https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/

Also make sure that the tauri submodule is properly cloned as well.

If you encounter issues with npm first check your node version and update  
to a later version.

## Contributing

Any contributions are welcome, if you add vue.js code try to follow their style guide.
If you can implement something with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) prefer it over  
implementing itself.  
Cleanup pr's are also very welcome since this is my first vue/tauri project.

npm install
